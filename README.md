 I’m @BackonyInSaxony and I do random stuff from time to time. I usually do Python stuff and may do Lua and javascript stuff in the future.

 I’m interested in whatever I'm interested in right now.

 I’m currently learning Javascript and Lua.

 How to reach me ... You don't unless you know me personally :)

 Pronouns: I'm a guy so you know what to use (He/Him).

 Fun fact: Even though dragonflies have six legs, they cannot walk.
